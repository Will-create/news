== DESCRIPTION ==

We believe that every theme should facilitate creative writing, not hinder it. We also believe that each site should have the opportunity to be unique. Since the beginning, we have listened to countless suggestions and requests for features that really matter. Here's a theme that's user-friendly, feature-packed, and endlessly customisable, for both beginners and advanced creators. Feel at home with more than 40 languages and backed with active community support, where questions, ideas and suggestions are always welcomed. Now Gutenberg compatible.

== FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

## 1. Where should I go for the theme's support? ##

Please direct all support requests for the theme at the theme's Support Forum.
https://forum.graphene-theme.com/


## 2. The post's featured image is replacing my header image. Help! ##

This is actually one of the theme's features. Any featured image that has a size greater than or equal to the theme's header image size (960 x 198 pixels by default) will replace the header image when the post/page that featured image is assigned to is being displayed. It enables you to have different header image for different posts and/or pages. If you want to disable this feature, simply tick the "Disable Featured Image replacing header image" option in Customize > Graphene: General > Header.


## 3. Can I modify Graphene? ##

The Graphene WordPress theme is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3. The full text of that licence is included with the theme's licence.txt file.

Releasing the theme under that licence means, among others, that you are free to modify the theme in any way for any purpose (including commercial) without any obligation to the theme's author. However, if you decide to redistribute the theme, the licence dictates that you must release the theme under the same licence, GPLv3.

But of course, the author would always appreciate donations to support ongoing and future developments of the theme.


## 4. Is the theme compatible with this plugin or that plugin? ##

We don't know. With so many plugins available for WordPress, there's no way that we (or anybody else for that matter) can test for compatibility for all of them. Having said that, the theme is built with all the necessary WordPress components included with it, so chances are most plugins will be compatible with the theme.

Our suggestion is to just install the plugin and try it. If you stumble into problem, ask for support from the plugin author first. If the plugin author says that it's a problems with the theme, you know where to find support.


== HEADER IMAGE CREDITS ==

    * "Flow" header image by Quantin Houyoux (http://www.sxc.hu/profile/quentinh)
    * "Fluid", "Techno", "Fireworks", and "Sparkle" header images by Ilco (http://www.sxc.hu/profile/ilco)
